## [Unreleased]

### Added
- On a repository whose architecture graph Yggdrasil holds, the merge checklist now runs `yg check` on the branch itself, whatever else the gate runs. A graph that refuses the change refuses the merge. Starting a horde on such a repository says so.
- Showing a node now lists the rules its code must satisfy, each with what breaking it costs: one blocks the merge, one only warns, one is not in force yet. Owners and workers are told to read them before they touch the node.
- Starting a horde now works out how this repository runs its tests — npm, Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Go, Python, Make — and what its tests are named, and says what it found. Where it can work out neither, it says that too and asks, instead of leaving a merge check that quietly passes on everything.
- The merge check that proves a new test is load-bearing no longer passes silently on a repository whose tests it does not recognise: it refuses, and says which setting to fill in. When it does pass, it names the patterns it looked for.
- Marking a ticket merged now records the merge everywhere it needs to be recorded. The mission's evidence list used to stay empty unless the same merge was entered a second time by hand.
- The mission charter — the goal, what is out of scope, the evidence the mission is judged by, and every later amendment — can now be written and read with a command instead of by hand. Rewriting it reports what happened to the evidence list, and warns when a rewrite drops something a verifier already proved.
- Settings that hold a list of values — the test patterns, the protected paths — can now be set to a list. They used to be stored as text and broke the merge check.
